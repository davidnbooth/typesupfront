`.vscode/extensions.json`, `.vscode/settings.json`, and `.eslintrc.js` are just to set up eslint, jshint, and cspell.  `jsconfig.json` turns on the JS type checker in vscode. All this might be overkill for such a simple project but I like to use them for all JS projects.  

`generator.js` was used to generate the code.  

`index.d.ts`, `tsconfig.json`, and `tslint.json` are for submittal to DefinitelyTyped.  

`typesUpFront.js` is the source code.
